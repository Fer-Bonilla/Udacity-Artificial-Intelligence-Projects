# Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree

Repository for Udacity's Blockchain Developer Nanodegree. Learn to write programs using the foundational AI algorithms powering everything from NASA’s Mars Rover to DeepMind’s AlphaGo Zero. You’ll master Beam Search and Random Hill Climbing, Bayes Networks and Hidden Markov Models, and more.

# Course program

## 1. Constraint Satisfaction Problems

   Use constraint propagation and search to build an agent that reasons like a human would to efficiently solve any Sudoku puzzle.

## 2. Search, Optimization, and Planning

   Build agents that can reason to achieve their goals using search and symbolic logic—like the NASA Mars rovers.
